# diceroller
Katie Harold dice roller program


Well I basically edited the original picker code to make a dice roller 
program. I am having problems figuring out how to get the code into
github.. But right now by program will roll two dice and it will spit
out that you have rolled blah with dice blah. I can't figure out how to make it go on separate lines though.. it just keeps replacing over the
one before which I think is because of the append but I'm not sure.

Yea so basically it's the jquery that I don't know how to fix.. and the fact that I don't know how to get the whole directory of the original picker to get onto github.
